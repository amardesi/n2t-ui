<h1>NOID: Nice Opaque IDentifier (minter and name resolver)</h1>
<p class="leftheaders">Have you ever noticed how some of the most &quot;mission critical&quot; identifiers in
your daily life are numbers? How often do you use</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>a driver's license number,</li>
<li>a social security number, or</li>
<li>a bank or credit card account number</li>
</ul>
<p>instead of your name and address, or a photo of your honest, smiling face? We
use numbers because they are short, precise, and opaque. Opaque identifiers,
such as numbers or random combinations of letters, are useful as long-term
descriptors for information objects because they don't contain information that
is at risk of becoming untrue later.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="why-opaque-identifiers">
<h1>Why opaque identifiers</h1>
<p>Non-opaque descriptors represent object properties that change over time:
subject classifiers, where an object &quot;lives&quot;, the spelling of an author's name,
etc. They can also be imprecise in large collections where a keyword or title
search returns too many results. Moreover, unstable or impersistent identifiers,
such as a web address that worked 6 months ago but not today, are a common
complaint. So it is important to have precise, stable identifiers that don't
include vague or changeable properties.</p>
<p>To help stability, an opaque identifier doesn't contain any information related
to potentially changeable properties. For instance, if an identifier contains an
organizational acronym and that organization is merged with another, there is
often political pressure to break with the past, which means pressure not to
support previously published identifiers in which the old acronym appears.
Opaque identifiers also have the advantage that they can be short; for example,
using combinations of letters and digits, only four characters are needed to
represent as many as 1.6 million identifiers.</p>
<p>While opaque object identifiers have distinct advantages, they aren't always
easy to use. They contain no widely recognizable words that allow people to
guess what the object is, and are hard to repair because a typo doesn't create
an obviously misspelled word.</p>

<p>The NOID software tool mints (generates) opaque identifiers and tracks
information to help them remain unique, stable, and closely connected to the
objects that they identify. These identifiers should be opaque enough to age and
travel well, but should easily resolve (connect you) to objects and to their
descriptions.</p>
<p>Identifiers minted by NOID have long-term and short-term uses. For example, NOID
can mint transaction identifiers and short-term web session keys. A more visible
use of NOID is to mint identifiers for the purpose of creating long-term
persistent object names (e.g., ARKs, Handles); embedded inside a URL, such an
identifier can provide object access when entered into a web browser.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-noid-works">
<h1>How NOID works</h1>
<p>NOID starts out by creating a small, fast database to make sure that no
identifier is ever minted twice. At that time you specify the format of the
identifiers you want, and you can ask for a &quot;check character&quot; to be added upon
minting that will later allow detection of the most common transcription errors.
Once it's up and running, you can mint identifiers at will until the available
identifiers run out, at which point you can create a new minter. The cost to set
up or take down a minter is low, so it is not uncommon for an organization to
run dozens of minters (for different purposes) at once; guidelines are under
preparation for running multiple minters, keeping identifiers unique between
different minters, etc.</p>
<p>Noids (identifiers minted by NOID) can be minted remotely at a central location
in your organization's internal web, or minted directly (&quot;command-line&quot;) by a
program that doesn't require network access. The CDL uses both approaches in
managing its own identifiers, and also supports a minter operated remotely by
the Internet Archive for its mass book digitization effort in the Open Content
Alliance. The CDL is considering setting up a remote minter that will allow
non-CDL users to generate unique, &quot;preservation ready&quot; identifiers of their own.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="noids-and-arks">
<h1>Noids and ARKs</h1>
<p>Noids are not the same thing as ARKs, but can be used to form them. ARKs are
persistent identifiers that are actionable (work in your web browser) and will
connect you to object metadata by adding a '?' to the end. A number of
organizations use NOID to create a core identifier, such as</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
13030/tf5p30086k
</pre>
<p>and then embed that NOID in a URL to create an ARK, such as</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/tf5p30086k
</pre>
<p>The NOID tool is not necessary to generate ARKs, but has been used for that
purpose by organizations such as</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the National Library of France,</li>
<li>the Internet Archive,</li>
<li>Portico (the permanent archive of electronic scholarly journals),</li>
<li>University of California, Berkeley, and</li>
<li>New York University.</li>
</ul>
<p>NOID has also been used to extensively to generate Handle identifiers at
Cornell, North Carolina State, and Goettingen universities. Programmers
at Princeton University developed graphical user interfaces for NOID and
ARK.</p>

<h1>NOID as local resolver versus the Name-to-Thing (N2T) shared global resolver</h1>
<p>What many organizations need to help make their URLs more persistent is a way to
take incoming requests for those URLs and redirect (&quot;forward&quot;) them to the
present object locations. The idea is that their published (persistent) URL need
never change provided that the actual location (a different URL that is not
suitable for long-term reference) can change whenever they move the object. A
system that redirects names this way is known as a name resolver.</p>
<p>NOID can be set up as a name resolver working behind a web server. There it acts
as an on-the-fly translator of the permanent published &quot;names&quot; (URLs) into
temporary locations. In this type of arrangement, NOID maintains a fast lookup
table that is consulted each time a web browser requests a long-term URL from
the server. The NOID table of locations can be maintained centrally and updated
remotely in a manner similar to remote minting.</p>
<p>One persistence threat that NOID by itself cannot guard against is when an
organization and its web server cease to exist. For this reason, &quot;Name to
Thing&quot; (N2T.net) was set up as a shared global resolver.</p>
