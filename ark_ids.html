<h1>Archival Resource Key (ARK) Identifiers</h1>
<p>ARKs are URLs designed to support long-term access to information objects.
In 2001 ARKs were introduced to identify objects of any type:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>digital objects – documents, databases, images, software, websites, etc.</li>
<li>physical objects – books, bones, statues, etc.</li>
<li>living beings and groups – people, animals, companies, orchestras, etc.</li>
<li>intangible objects – places, chemicals, diseases, vocabulary terms, performances, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>ARKs are assigned for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>affordability – there are no fees to assign or use ARKs</li>
<li>self-sufficiency – you can host ARKs on your own web server, eg, <a class="reference external" href="/e/noid.html">Noid (Nice
Opaque Identifiers)</a> open source software</li>
<li>portability – you can move ARKs to other servers without losing their core
identities</li>
<li>global resolvability – you can host ARKs at a well-known server, eg, at the
N2T.net (Name-to-Thing) resolver</li>
<li>density – ARKs handle mixed case, permitting shorter identifiers (CD, Cd,
cD, cd are all distinct)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some advantages of ARKs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>simplicity – access relies only on mainstream web &quot;redirects&quot; and ordinary
&quot;get&quot; requests</li>
<li>utility – with &quot;inflections&quot; (different endings), an ARK should access data
, metadata, promises, and more</li>
<li>compatibility – inflections don't conflict with &quot;linked data content
negotiation&quot; (a harder and limited way to access metadata)</li>
<li>versatility – ARKs support persistence statements to describe different
kinds of long-term access</li>
<li>transparency – no identifier can guarantee stability, and ARK inflections
help users make informed judgements</li>
<li>visibility – syntax rules make ARKs easy to extract from texts and to
compare for variant and containment relationships</li>
<li>openness – unlike other persistent identifiers, ARKs don't lock you into
one specific, fee-based management and resolution infrastructure</li>
<li>impact – ARKs appear in Thomson Reuters’ Data Citation Index ℠ and
ORCID researcher profiles</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 2001 over 550 organizations spread across fifteen countries registered
to assign ARKs.  Registrants include libraries, archives, museums (Smithsonian)
, publishers, government agencies, academic institutions (Princeton), and
technology companies (Google). Some of the major users are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The California Digital Library</li>
<li>The Internet Archive</li>
<li>National Library of France (Bibliothèque nationale de France)</li>
<li>Portico Digital Preservation Service</li>
<li>University of California Berkeley</li>
<li>University of North Texas</li>
<li>University of Chicago</li>
<li>University College Dublin</li>
<li>The British Library</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a discussion group for ARKs (Archival Resource Keys) at</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/group/arks-forum">https://groups.google.com/group/arks-forum</a></blockquote>
<p>The group is intended as a public forum for people interested in sharing with
and learning from others about how ARKs have been or could be used in
identifier applications.</p>
<p>The forum is also intended as a mechanism for the CDL, in its role as the ARK
scheme maintenance agency, to seek community feedback on a number of longer
term issues and activities, including</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>finalizing the ARK specification as an Internet RFC,</li>
<li>clarifying local and global resolution options, and</li>
<li>promoting metadata retrieval in a linked data environment.</li>

<h1>ARK Anatomy</h1>
<p>An ARK is represented by a sequence of characters that contains the label,
&quot;<tt class="docutils literal">ark:</tt>&quot;. When embedded in a URL, it is preceded by the protocol  (&quot;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">http://</span></tt>&quot;
or &quot;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">https://</span></tt>&quot;) and name of a service that provides support for that ARK.
That service name, or the &quot;Name Mapping Authority&quot; (NMA), is mutable and
replaceable, as neither the web server itself nor the current web protocols are
expected to last longer than the identified objects. The immutable, globally
unique identifier follows the &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">ark:</tt>&quot; label. This includes a &quot;Name Assigning
Authority Number&quot; (NAAN) identifying the naming organization, followed by the
name that it assigns to the object. Please visit the <a class="reference external" href="https://goo.gl/forms/bmckLSPpbzpZ5dix1">NAAN request form</a> if you
are interested in generating and using ARKs for your information objects.</p>
<p>Here is a diagrammed example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
   http://example.org/ark:/12025/654xz321/s3/f8.05v.tiff
   \________________/ \__/ \___/ \______/ \____________/
     (replaceable)     |     |      |       Qualifier
          |       ARK Label  |      |    (NMA-supported)
          |                  |      |
Name Mapping Authority       |    Name (NAA-assigned)
         (NMA)               |
                  Name Assigning Authority Number (NAAN)
</pre>
<p>The ARK syntax can be summarized,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
[http://NMA/]ark:/NAAN/Name[Qualifier]
</pre>
<p>The NMA part, which makes the ARK actionable (clickable in a web browser), is
in brackets to indicate that it is optional and replaceable. ARKs are intended
to work with objects that last longer than the organizations that provide
services for them, so when the provider changes it should not affect the
object's identity. A different provider hosting the object would simply replace
the NMA to reflect the new &quot;home&quot; of the object. For example,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://bnf.fr/ark:/13030/tf5p30086k
</pre>
<p>might become</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://portico.org/ark:/13030/tf5p30086k
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="naan-the-name-assigning-authority-number">
<h1>NAAN: the Name Assigning Authority Number</h1>
<p>The NAAN part, following the &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">ark:</tt>&quot; label, uniquely identifies the organization
that assigned the Name part of the ARK. Often the initial access provider (the
first NMA) coincides with the original namer (represented by the NAAN),
however, access may be provided by one or more different entities instead of or
in addition to the original naming authority.</p>
<p>The NAAN used above, 13030, represents the California Digital Library. As of
2018, over 550 organizations have registered for ARK NAANs, including numerous
universities, Google, the Internet Archive, WIPO, the British Library, and
other national libraries.</p>
<p>Any stable memory organization may obtain a NAAN at no cost and begin assigning
ARKs. Please contact the CDL if you are interested in generating and using ARKs
for your information objects.</p>
<p>CDL maintains a complete registry of all currently assigned NAANs, which is
mirrored at the (U.S.) National Library of Medicine and the Bibliothèque
nationale de France.</p>

<div class="section" id="creating-and-managing-arks">
<h1>Creating and Managing ARKs</h1>
<p>Once your organization has a Name Assigning Authority Number (NAAN), you may
begin using it immediately to assign ARKs.</p>
<p>In thinking about how to manage the namespace, you may find it helpful to
consider the usual practice of partitioning it with reserved prefixes of, say
1-5 characters, eg, names of the form &quot;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ark:/NAAN/xt3....</span></tt>&quot; for each
&quot;sub-publisher&quot; in an organization. Opaque prefixes that only have meaning to
information professionals are often a good idea and have precedent in schemes
such as ISBN and ISSN. The ARK specification is currently the best guide for
how to create URLs that comply with ARK rules, although it is fairly technical.</p>
<p>You can use any system you wish to manage your identifiers. One approach is to
create and assign ARKs as a side-effect of deposit into a content repository,
with ARKs publicized as being hosted on your server, eg,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://myrepo.example.org/ark:/12345/bcd987
</pre>
<p>Another option is to use the EZID service (<a class="reference external" href="http://ezid.cdlib.org">http://ezid.cdlib.org</a>), which means
your ARKs would appear to be hosted at n2t.net, as in</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://n2t.net/ark:/12345/bcd987
</pre>
<p>As with any identifier scheme, persistence requires a redirectable reference to
content in stable storage. EZID operates on a cost-recovery basis and can be
used to manage your namespace, which includes minting and resolving ARKs (and
other identifiers), as well as maintaining metadata. There's is also guidance
on CDL Identifier Conventions available.</p>
<p>Because long-term identifiers often look like random strings of letters and
digits, organizations typically use software to generate (or mint, in ARK
parlance) and track identifiers. To mint ARKs, you may use any software that
can produce identifiers conforming to the ARK specification. CDL uses the open
source <a class="reference external" href="/e/noid.html">Noid</a> (nice opaque identifiers, rhymes with &quot;employed&quot;) software, which
creates minters and accepts commands that operate them. The noid software
documentation explains how to use noid not only to mint identifiers but also to
serve as an institution's &quot;identifier resolver&quot;.</p>
<p>Once minted and publicized as being associated with a specific object, the ARK
becomes a stable, unique, and compact reference that can be included in metadata
records, databases, redirection tables, etc. It is often useful to generate and
assign ARKs well before institutional commitment has been decided because it is
easier than changing the original object identifier that may have been in long
established use prior to that decision.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="arks-in-action-inflections">
<h1>ARKs in Action – Inflections</h1>
<p>An ARK provides extra services above and beyond that of an ordinary URL. Instead
of connecting to one thing, an ARK should connect to three things:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>the object itself,</li>
<li>a brief metadata record if you append a single question mark to the ARK, and</li>
<li>a maintenance commitment from the current server when you append two question marks.</li>
</ul>
<p>This is a achieved through the use of &quot;inflections&quot;, or different kinds of
endings. With no ending, the ARK (in a URL) gives you what you expect from a web
browser. If you add a single '<tt class="docutils literal">?</tt>' to the end, for example,</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth346793/?
</pre>
<p>it returns a brief machine- and eye-readable metadata record; in this case, an
Electronic Resource Citation (ERC) using Dublin Core Kernel metadata., such
as</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
erc:
who: Dallas (Tex.). Police Dept.
what: [Photographs of Identification Cards]
when: 1963
where: http://texashistory.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metapth346793/
</pre>
<p>Adding '<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">??</span></tt>' to the end should return a policy statement. It is a side-benefit of
ARKs that an object's metadata doesn't need an identifier different from that
for the object, which cuts in half the number of identifiers that need to be
generated and managed.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cdl-name-assignment-and-support-policy-statements">
<h1>CDL Name Assignment and Support Policy Statements</h1>
<p>The CDL assigns identifiers within the ARK domain under the NAAN 13030 and
according to the following principles:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>No ARK shall be re-assigned; that is, once an ARK-to-object association has
been made public, that association shall be considered unique into the
indefinite future.</li>
<li>To help them age and travel well, the Name part of CDL-assigned ARKs shall
contain no widely recognizable semantic information (to the extent possible).</li>
<li>CDL-assigned ARKs shall be generated with a terminal check character that
guarantees them against single character errors and transposition errors.</li>
</ul>
<p>Institutions that generate ARKs may want to follow similar principles or develop
their own assignment policies.</p>
<p>Similarly, but in the role of an NMA and not an NAA, institutions will want to
develop service commitment statements for the objects themselves. These NMA
commitments are different from NAA identifier assignment policies. In many
cases, the NAA will operate initially as the first NMA, but for long-lived
objects over time, chances are that these will become different organizations
(e.g., a highly successful object may easily outlive its NAA).</p>
<p>In developing such statements, it is useful to recognize first, that managing a
digital object may require altering it as appropriate to ensure its stability,
and second, that the declared level of commitment may change as the requirements
and policies for persistence become better understood over time, and as the
institution implements procedures and guidelines] for maintaining the objects
that it manages. The US National Library of Medicine has developed some
permanence ratings that may be of interest here.</p>
<p>There is also information available about CDL <a class="reference external" href="http://ezid.cdlib.org/learn/id_concepts">Identifier Conventions</a>.</p>
