<h1>ARK</h1>
<p>ARKs are URLs designed to support long-term access to information objects.
In 2001 ARKs were introduced to identify objects of any type:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>digital objects – documents, databases, images, software, websites, etc.</li>
<li>physical objects – books, bones, statues, etc.</li>
<li>living beings and groups – people, animals, companies, orchestras, etc.</li>
<li>intangible objects – places, chemicals, diseases, vocabulary terms, performances, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>ARKs are assigned for a variety of reasons:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>affordability – there are no fees to assign or use ARKs</li>
<li>self-sufficiency – you can host ARKs on your own web server, eg, Noid (Nice
Opaque Identifiers) open source software</li>
<li>portability – you can move ARKs to other servers without losing their core
identities</li>
<li>global resolvability – you can host ARKs at a well-known server, eg, at the
N2T.net (Name-to-Thing) resolver</li>
<li>density – ARKs handle mixed case, permitting shorter identifiers (CD, Cd,
cD, cd are all distinct)</li>
</ul>
<p>Some advantages of ARKs:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>simplicity – access relies only on mainstream web &quot;redirects&quot; and ordinary
&quot;get&quot; requests</li>
<li>utility – with &quot;inflections&quot; (different endings), an ARK should access data
, metadata, promises, and more</li>
<li>compatibility – inflections don't conflict with &quot;linked data content
negotiation&quot; (a harder and limited way to access metadata)</li>
<li>versatility – ARKs support persistence statements to describe different
kinds of long-term access</li>
<li>transparency – no identifier can guarantee stability, and ARK inflections
help users make informed judgements</li>
<li>visibility – syntax rules make ARKs easy to extract from texts and to
compare for variant and containment relationships</li>
<li>openness – unlike other persistent identifiers, ARKs don't lock you into
one specific, fee-based management and resolution infrastructure</li>
<li>impact – ARKs appear in Thomson Reuters’ Data Citation Index ℠ and
ORCID researcher profiles</li>
</ul>
<p>Since 2001 over 550 organizations spread across fifteen countries registered
to assign ARKs.  Registrants include libraries, archives, museums (Smithsonian)
, publishers, government agencies, academic institutions (Princeton), and
technology companies (Google). Some of the major users are</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The California Digital Library</li>
<li>The Internet Archive</li>
<li>National Library of France (Bibliothèque nationale de France)</li>
<li>Portico Digital Preservation Service</li>
<li>University of California Berkeley</li>
<li>University of North Texas</li>
<li>University of Chicago</li>
<li>University College Dublin</li>
<li>The British Library</li>
</ul>
<p>There is a discussion group for ARKs (Archival Resource Keys) at</p>
<blockquote>
<a class="reference external" href="https://groups.google.com/group/arks-forum">https://groups.google.com/group/arks-forum</a></blockquote>
<p>The group is intended as a public forum for people interested in sharing with
and learning from others about how ARKs have been or could be used in
identifier applications.</p>
<p>The forum is also intended as a mechanism for the CDL, in its role as the ARK
scheme maintenance agency, to seek community feedback on a number of longer
term issues and activities, including</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>finalizing the ARK specification as an Internet RFC,</li>
<li>clarifying local and global resolution options, and</li>
<li>promoting metadata retrieval in a linked data environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is a brief summary of other resources relevant to ARKs.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The ARK Identifier Scheme Specification PDF version     TXT version</li>
<li>Towards Electronic Persistence Using ARK Identifiers (July 2003)</li>
<li>ARK and CDL Identifier conventions</li>
<li>Archival Resource Key - Wikipedia</li>
<li>Noid (Nice Opaque Identifiers) open source software for minting and resolving ARKs on your own</li>
<li>ARK plugin for Omeka that creates and manages ARKs for the Omeka open source web-publishing platform</li>
<li>EZID service: long term identifiers made easy, if you would rather not install and maintain those services yourself</li>
<li>N2T.net resolver: Name-to-Thing, a single global resolver at n2t.net</li>
